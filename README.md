I added this line as a part of the first commit in the  merge branch.

I then created a pull request:
https://github.com/ashwnacharya/merge_squash_rebase/pull/1
The above line I added in the second commit.

Then I created another commit where I added this line. I also edited the previous lines.

Now I am adding this line in the first commit of the squash_and_merge branch.

I then created a pull request:
https://github.com/ashwnacharya/merge_squash_rebase/pull/2

Then I created another commit where I added this line. I also edited the previous lines.
